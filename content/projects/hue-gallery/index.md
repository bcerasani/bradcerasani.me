I wrote an article for the December 2016 issue of net magazine detailing how to create an immersive photo browsing experience with Philips Hue.

My [coworker](https://brandonjpierce.com/) and I created a project that extracts an imageâ€™s colour palette, refines the selection by filtering dark and less saturated values, and sends the resulting values to the Philips Hue API when an image is scrolled into view. Philips Hue Sync (released 2018) is a better, realtime way of achieving the same effect at the OS level, and Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box (2019) is a standalone device that achieves this effect with existing media players.

The original article is available in full [here](/writing/hue-gallery/), as well as an accompanying video my partner and I made of the effect in action.
