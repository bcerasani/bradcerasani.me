In 2015 Ikeaâ€™s Bekant series sit/stand desk came to Canada.

I wrote a scraper that polled Ikeaâ€™s website for stock at my local store, and picked one up as soon as they were available. The desk worked fine, but the controller was very basic and didnâ€™t have height presets, so I decided to make my own.

I assumed the Ikea legs had some sort of sync unit and limit switches within them, and that I could just short the three-conductor controller wire in order to make the desk go up or down. This did not end up being the case, so I opened up the Ikea controller module and found a small PCB within it.

To interface with this PCB as non-destructively as possible, I made a replacement for the original buttonâ€™s ribbon wire out of plastic, flexible adhesive, and wires that I attached to a screw terminal. The screw terminal is connected to a bank of two relays for software control, and a 3.5mm headphone jack for pluggable hardware control in the event that the software isnâ€™t working.

The relays are connected to a Raspberry Pi running a basic controller software I wrote in Python and Node.js. It uses feedback from an ultrasonic sensor to measure the deskâ€™s height. For software control, I made a series of Alfred shortcuts on my Mac that sent requests to the deskâ€™s API. For hardware control, I wired up a SPDT on-off-on toggle switch.

At one point I wrote a wrapper for the deskâ€™s API and opened it up to the internet during a meeting with my team at Black Pixel. This allowed my coworkers to control the deskâ€™s height using slash commands in Slack. This was not one of my better ideas, but made for a memorable meeting (for me anyway).
