## 1. Can you give me info on your background? This is to help me build the introduction.

I'm a designer/developer from central Canada. I've lived in a handful of cities across Canada and the US but have called Winnipeg, Manitoba home for 13 years now. I play a few different instruments, and worked in a music store before doing design work full-time. I've written, recorded, and produced two albums with a trio called Hoist. Our average height is 6'3". I own and operate a small web shop called Shedbot that builds websites for clients across Canada and beyond.

## 2. Tell me about yourself and your work: what you're passionate about, what inspires you, and where you're going.

I focus on responsive, future-friendly front-end design and development. This means I design and code websites that flex and adapt to the device the user is viewing them on. Progressive enhancement ensures that a user visiting a site from their phone on a congested mobile network isn't forced to download the same site assets they would see on their 30" display at the office. Future-friendly development means writing flexible, modular code structure that is mindful of what's next in tech.

I'm inspired by quality craft, regardless of medium. It is endearing witnessing a maker who is good at what they're making.

I'm also inspired by my city and the people that call it home. It is easy to stare at a screen, distracted by what the rest of the world is up to while forgetting about the adventures in our own backyards. Winnipeg has an incredibly rich arts and cultural scene, especially for a city of relatively small size. In the past few years our downtown has seen some really cool architectural installations, like a huge steel/LED sculpture called Emptyful that's shaped like an Erlenmeyer flask, and an open air performing arts venue called OMS Stage that looks straight out of a science fiction movie. When the rivers freeze in the winter, we clear the longest skating trail in the world and line it with warming huts that are designed in an annual architectural competition. I think there's something to be said for the resilience and outward thinking this city embraces.

Right now I'm balancing client work with the study of Ruby/Rails so I can start building the applications I wish existed or existed better. I've felt good traction the past 6 weeks or so; progress is so addictive.

## 3. Tell me about your space. What's your aesthetic? What do you like or dislike about it? What would you change if you could?

My space is a bit of an audio playground, with instruments and recording gear and a life size cardboard cutout of Raj Koothrappali (he's camera shy). I have a flawless Fender Rhodes piano that was built in March of 1972, and will forever be the coolest thing I own.

The studio monitors on my desk sit on foam/steel wedges that isolate the speaker vibrations from my work surface. These are my go-to for listening to most music, but if I'm listening to a concert recording I'll also bring up the mono speaker stack for a different timbre. If I'm listening to something with poor quality sound, I'll route the audio through an old GE stereo I modded a few years ago that can plug directly into my mixer. This is kind of like the aural equivalent of taking a mediocre picture of your feet with Instagram and applying a filter to make it 'better'.

The big white pillow things on my walls are broadband absorbers that help eliminate sound reflections and frequency nodes. Each panel is 4" of rigid fiberglass insulation and an open wood frame that is wrapped in fabric and hung with picture frame wire.

My 'window treatment' (if I can even call it that) is several layers of translucent plastic tablecloth, held in place with binder clips and magnets. It turns my basement window well into a big softbox. When rabbits hop in the garden above it's like a shadow puppet show without the puppets.

I'm constantly exploring ergonomics, and love finding new ways to make working better.

Currently my wrists rest on a water damaged piece of hardboard from an old drawer. This sits atop a stack of dollar store craft foam that raises the leading edge of my keyboard and trackpad so they parallel my desk. I think most people have increased fidelity in their fingers and thumbs with their wrists either parallel to their desks or relaxed forward, instead of pulled back as most keyboard designs imply. This is in part why pianists are trained not to drop their wrists while playing.

My display sits on a 3" roll of black duct tape, the underside of which is covered by parchment paper. Parchment paper has a low coefficient of friction, so slides around my glass desk with ease.

If I could change anything about my current setup, I definitely wouldn't be working on a black glass desk. It is an incredible pain to keep clean. I'd like to try a sit-stand desk with a wood surface and motorized legs.

My dream space would have one of those bulk Jelly Belly dispensers that only stocked the good flavours and never ran out. The flooring would be something like polished concrete so I could push my desk and roll around really far without slowing down because I'm still 12 at heart.

## 4. You have both an Embody and an Aeron in your space (wow!). Why do you have the different chairs, what do you like about them, and how do they differ for you? Would you recommend them to others?

I like them both, and they are very different. I typically start the work day in the Aeron, because I love its forward tilt. It arches my back and keeps my body in attentive posture, which helps me kickstart productivity if I stayed up too late writing code or playing hockey. The Embody feels more relaxed to me, and I'm most comfortable in it slightly reclined. I usually tackle less intensive tasks in the Embody, like long-form reading or answering email. The Embody's arm rests adjust closer to my body than the Aeron's do, which I find helpful in reducing shoulder strain.

It may seem excessive to have two high-end chairs in such close proximity, but an investment in design and comfort is easily justifiable to someone who spends as much time at a desk as I do.

## 5. Be sure to list any links you'd like me to possibly include.
