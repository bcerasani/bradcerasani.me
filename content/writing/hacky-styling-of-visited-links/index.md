In HTML, `<a>` tags have 4 CSS pseudo classes that are used to style hyperlinks in different states: `:link` `:visited` `:hover` and `:active`

We used to be able to style these pseudo classes with whatever CSS we wanted, but in early 2010 a [privacy vulnerability](http://blog.mozilla.org/security/2010/03/31/plugging-the-css-history-leak/) forced browsers to restrict what CSS properties were allowed for the `:visited` class.

Here's what properties we're currently allowed to use for `:visited` elements:

```css
a:visited {
  outline-color: ;
  border-color: ;
  background-color: ;
  color: ;
}
```

Boring, eh? Not to worry, we can work with this.

## Basic Link Styling

First, we'll create a link and give it some styling.

_I'm using SCSS/Sass instead of vanilla CSS. If you are unfamiliar with Sass, [start here](http://sass-lang.com/guide)._

```html
<a href="#!" class="demo">AWESOME</a>
```

```scss
$accent: #3ba7bb;

a.demo {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.75rem 3rem;
  border: 2px solid $accent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background: $accent;
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 500;
  line-height: 1;
}
```

Result:

<a href="#!" class="demo">AWESOME</a>

Cool! Let's design a `:visited` style.

## CSS Pseudo Elements

Pseudo elements in CSS are **awesome**. [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/) sums it up best:

> For every element on the page, you get two more free ones that you can do just about anything another HTML element could do.

We'll use a CSS pseudo element to help style the `:visited` state of our link. While pseudo elements have the same CSS property restrictions as the `<a>` tag, with absolute positioning and some basic colour tricks we can essentially hide a `:visited` style in our link right from the start.

Let's add a check mark using pseudo element `:after`. I'm using a check mark from [icomoon](http://icomoon.io/), but if you aren't familiar with icon fonts, grab a character from [here](http://copypastecharacter.com/) and insert it on line 19 between the double quotes.

```scss
$accent: #3ba7bb;

a.demo {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.75rem 3rem;
  border: 2px solid $accent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background: $accent;
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 500;
  line-height: 1;
  &:after {
    position: absolute;
    right: 1.5rem;
    width: 1rem;
    height: 1rem;
    content: '\e602';
    font-family: icomoon;
  }
}
```

Result:

<a href="#!" class="demo step-two">AWESOME</a>

## Building Functionality

While we can't technically 'add' the check mark strictly to `:visited` links, we can hide it in a link's natural state by changing its colour to match the background.

Now we can style the `:visited` state to provide some visual contrast and show off the check mark and border, both of which were disguised originally.

```scss
$accent: #3ba7bb;

a.demo {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.75rem 3rem;
  border: 2px solid $accent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background: $accent;
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 500;
  line-height: 1;
  &:after {
    position: absolute;
    right: 1.5rem;
    width: 1rem;
    height: 1rem;
    color: $accent;
    content: '\e602';
    font-family: icomoon;
  }
  &:visited {
    border-color: #333333;
    background-color: #fafafa;
    color: #333333;
    &:after {
      color: #49b749;
    }
  }
}
```

Give it a try:

<a href="http://bit.ly/16m376q" class="demo step-two step-three">AWESOME</a>

Pretty cool, eh?

## Wrap-Up

With pure CSS we've created an interesting visual style for visited links without sacrificing user privacy or relying on Javascript. Kickass!
